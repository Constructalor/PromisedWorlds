# Promised Worlds
**Promised Worlds is a faithful revival of the solar systems Intercept Games planned to release for KSP 2. Want to brave the crater lakes of Gurdamma? Launch between the molten seas of Rask and Rusk? Our team of veteran KSP 1 modders is working around the globe to bring you those experiencesâ€”and more!**

So far, we have implemented the Debdeb System. The Tuun System is in the early stages of development, with a few planets implemented. The Qeg System is being conceptualized (an uncertain feature).

All content for Promised Worlds is being designed in-house. We are not using any KSP 2 assets. 
 
Each world has been meticulously crafted to align with KSP 2 development screenshots and data mining discoveries. For celestial bodies lacking implementation details (e.g., Dorau), we are applying creative liberties to attain what we feel were the KSP 2 developers' intentions.

Promised Worlds is currently in early access. Planets, moons, and other features are being added incrementally in updates. We're nearing a full release now with only a handful of features left to add.

# Installation

## CKAN
- Select "Promised Worlds - Debdeb" for the Debdeb system. CKAN will install the required dependencies.
- Tuun system: Coming Soon!

## SpaceDock 
SpaceDock installation is no longer supported. We have had repeated issues with uploading large files which make it impossible for us to keep updating the mod on SpaceDock. Please install via CKAN or by GitHub. If you have issues with GitHub, please contact a developer on the Discord server #help channel.

## Manual (GitHub)
- Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/Constructalor/PromisedWorlds/releases). You will need the Core zip file, along with the zip file for any systems you want. You can install any of the systems you like - you don't have to take them all.
- Extract the Core zip file, and put the contents of GameData in your GameData directory.
- For each system you want:
    - Extract the system's zip file, and put the contents of its GameData in your GameData directory. It will add a directory within PromisedWorlds.
- Download the mod's dependencies - [Kopernicus](https://github.com/kopernicus/kopernicus/releases), [ScaledDecorator](https://github.com/Sushutt/ScaledDecorator/releases), and [Singularity](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/193709-wip18x-112x-singularity-black-hole-shaders/) (This is only required if you wish to use wormholes)
- Extract these zip files and put all folders in GameData.
  
## Options
In the PromisedWorlds directory there is PromisedWorldsSettings.cfg with options for the mod:
- Wormholes (Requires Singularity for shaders)
- DistanceFactor (How far from Kerbol the systems will be)
- Rescale (Resize the systems, requires Sigma Dimensions)
- RealisticStarSize (Makes the stars more realistically sized relative to the planets)

# Most Recent Changes
## V1.1.2:
NEW FEATURES / IMPROVEMENTS:
- Improve Lapat and Ovin's ScaledSpace
- Random main menu bodies are now optional. Change RandomMainMenuBody to false in PromisedWorldsSettings.cfg to disable it and return to stock behavior.
- Glumo has a new orbit icon

BUGFIXES:
- Update Omasa's description to reflect the change in Mesma's orbit
- Removed ringed and atmospheric planets from being selected as the random main menu body, as rings would block the main menu text.

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Move all science definitions to localization. If you would like to help translate Promised Worlds, please ping @levitato5594 on our Discord server!
- Add dummy ModuleManager config to make it easier to detect installed systems. You can now do NEEDS[SystemDebdeb] to detect whether the Debdeb system is installed. This will be useful for mod developers wanting to be compatible with Promised Worlds.
- Planet debug settings are now a global toggle, under the debug section of PromisedWorldsSettings.cfg
