		//WPetula
		OmasaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is unusually soft, like wet clay or a muddy sponge. You contemplate going outside and making a mud castle, but you decide against it.
		OmasaSrfLandedMidlands = The ground is light and crunchy, like your favorite candy bar. You feel your stomach rumble.
		OmasaSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is airy but firm. Far below you, massive concentric rings circumnavigate Omasa's massive craters. You wonder if they were formed naturally, or you're not alone after all.
		OmasaSrfLandedPeaks = The ground slopes sharply toward the cratered lowlands just a few hundred meters from the ship. You can see Glumo's rings very clearly up here.
		OmasaInSpaceLow = Omasa's craters remind you of the whirlpools ancient Kerbals decorated maps of Kerbin with. Hopefully that's just a coincidence.
		OmasaInSpaceHigh = The surface is lumpy in some places and stepped in others. How strange.
