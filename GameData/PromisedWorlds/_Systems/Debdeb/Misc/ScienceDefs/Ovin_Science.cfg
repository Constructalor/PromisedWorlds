		OvinSrfLandedLowlands = You are deep in Ovin's gravity well -- AKA, your spacecraft's new, permanent home.
		OvinSrfLandedMidlands = The ground has been pulverized into an endless expanse of sand, dust, and other small, flat-ish things.
		OvinSrfLandedHighlands = You marvel at the gravity-smoothed landscape fracturing off into the unknown. It is a beautiful desolation.
		OvinSrfLandedMountains = How Ovin has mountains under such immense pressure is a mystery to you. How you plan to leave is also a mystery.
		OvinSrfLandedNedzerfjord = Nedzerfjord was named after the famous Kerben Nedzer, who died of crushed legs after trying to carry too many snacks.
		OvinSrfLandedValleyofDespair = Welcome to the Valley of Despair, named as such because...well, look at it.
		OvinSrfLandedGulfofHairy = The Gulf of Hairy is a massive canyon that looks like a jagged strand of hair from space. It is said that any Kerbal who sees it will  grow a magical blonde beard.
		OvinSrfLandedDustyCrater = The spacecraft sinks slightly into the soft regolith of the crater, making you wonder what would happen if Ovin had quicksand. Let us hope it does not.
		OvinSrfLandedHefftyCliffs = There is rock bottom, and then there is Heffty Cliffs bottom. It is said that those who reach rock bottom and start digging may find themselves here.
		OvinSrfLandedGreatNorthernRift = The Great Northern Rift is a massive ravine second only to the Great Southern Rift. We believe it was formed in a rare Ovin superquake.
		OvinSrfLandedGreatSouthernRift = The Great Southern Rift is the most dangerous rift in the Debdeb System. Many say it is the maw of The Kraken, as what goes in does not come back out.
		OvinSrfLandedLesserNorthernRift = The Lesser Northern Rift is the Greater Northern Rift's smaller, younger cousin. It is volatile and subject to sudden edge collapses.
		OvinSrfLandedVinitaFissure = Named after the late Vinita Kera, this fissure borders an enormous mountain range, making it an alluring but dangerous natural wonder.
		OvinFlyingLow = You fight to keep the craft intact under the extreme gravity. The extreme gravity giggles at your puny efforts.
		OvinFlyingHigh = The atmosphere wraps around your craft and tries to pull it down. Not far below, Ovin's smooth, teak surface is a siren's call.
		OvinInSpaceLow = Ovin's surface is flat as a pancake. If you descend, you will be too.
		OvinInSpaceHigh = Ovin is the god of wisdom and old age in ancient Kerbal mythology. Based on your travel preferences, it seems you don't wish to aquire either.
