		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is black and crunchy. It reminds you of charcoal, but there are no trees nearby to produce it.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = Everything is tinged grey. It's a little depressing, honestly. Can we go somewhere else?
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The landscape is chalky. Dust clings to the ship as it contacts the ground.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = Peaks...\nUh...what peaks? "Big hill" would be pushing it. I guess they mean peaks as in "jagged", not "mountain"?
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = They say Rosh's mare reminds Kerbals of onions. I, unfortunately, have to disagree. Like...what? Who comes up with this stuff?
		// Dysnomia ver.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = Looking out the window, flat, brown soil stretches off into the distance. You begin to wonder if Rosh is flat, before remembering that you'd just been in orbit.
		// TODO: Check Nedzer vs. Nezder
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = Named after Kerina Nezder, Mount Nezder is the tallest lump of stuff on Rosh. It is far from being the tallest mountain in the Debdeb System, though.
		RoshFlyingLow = The surface is very, very close. I'm just going to close my eyes and hope you've got this under control.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The surface is close, and the atmosphere is thin. Be careful, please!
		RoshInSpaceLow = It's a gloomy world down there. Next time, let's bring a few buckets of paint to help spruce things up. Maybe solar-powered Khristmas lights, too!
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Rosh looks like a stone-flavored gumball. That's about all you can tel

		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = The soil appears to have some very prevalent stratification to it, and think to yourself, 'how cool!' You then realise that you're finding soil to the most interesting part of this location. You wish you had picked a cooler spot.

		//Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = You reach down and manage to pull out a rock from the ground. It appears to be a chunk of ice with layers of ash in it, giving the sample a stratified appearance. Giving it a little pull, the layers come apart easily. You recall the words of Shrek Kerman...
