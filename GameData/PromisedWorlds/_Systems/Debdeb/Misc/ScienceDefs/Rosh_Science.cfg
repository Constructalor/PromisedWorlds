		// WPetula
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = A quick glance out the window tells you all you need to know; It's bumpy and brown out. If you squint hard enough, you can even see some mountains off in the distance.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = You look around your landing site, spotting many spikes jutting out of the ground. You shudder to think about what would've happened if you flew ever-so-slightly more recklessly.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = You enjoy the scenery that surrounds your lander. You do your best to ignore the cliffs and spikes sticking out of the ground.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = Outside your window is the bare expanse of space. You imagine this to be a good spot for an observatory, it's so clear out in the sky... Wait, how high did the atmosphere go?
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = Looking out the window, flat, brown soil stretches off into the distance. You begin to wonder if Rosh is flat, before remembering that you'd just been in orbit.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = You glance out the window, and feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Something is here... Something hidden.

		RoshFlyingLow = You look out the window, down to the ground below. You hope that you picked a good spot to land here.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The brown moon stretches on beneath you. For a moment, it looks like a fun skydive, but you know better. Probably.
		RoshInSpaceLow = As mountains whizz by scarily close to you, you wonder if it may be worth it to raise your orbit. Or maybe continue to be a daredevil, it's funner.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Staring down at Rosh, you picture landing on those soaring peaks. And then you immediately picture falling off them. Maybe you should look away.

	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = Around you, gentle lumps and gradual dips are sprinkled about the terrain. You think for a moment... It seems flat enough for a daredevil to take off from.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The terrain here is quite rough. You glance back over to your craft to make sure it's not tipped over.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = You make sure to keep your distance from a cliff as you look around. You note how uneven the ground is, as you hear a distant thump. That wasn't the ship falling over... Right?
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = You keep away from the nearby cliffs as you radio in to mission control, cracking a joke about how 'spacey' it is up here. When met with silence in response, you decide to just tell yourself it's the delay from being interstellar.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = The soil appears to have some very prevalent stratification to it, and think to yourself, 'how cool!' You then realise that you're finding soil to the most interesting part of this location. You wish you had picked a cooler spot.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = Your legs shake as you glance around. You feel tempted to call out for Bob, but fear the consenquences if he is present.

		RoshFlyingLow = Deciding to be a daredevil, you hang on to the side of your craft as it wobbles in flight. One of your hands slip, and you begin to reconsider this whole thing.
		RoshFlyingHigh = You consider skydiving for a moment. How cool would it be to be the first to skydive on an alien world? Right as you think about it, mission control screams at you to get back in. What a bunch of party-poopers...
		RoshInSpaceLow = You begin to wonder which of these mountains will be the one lucky enough to get a new green splat mark. You also begin to wonder if you should get back in the ship.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = You gaze down at Rosh. From this far up, it looks like a rotting onion. You reach to pinch your nose in advance, but smack yourself on accident.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The goo appears to have blobbed up into a ball. You wonder what kind of hoops you could shoot with it in the low gravity.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The goo appears to have blobbed up into a ball. You wonder what kind of hoops you could shoot with it in the low gravity.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The goo appears to have blobbed up into a ball. You wonder what kind of hoops you could shoot with it in the low gravity.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The goo leaps out of its canister and into space! You then see it fall back down to Rosh quickly thereafter, off the side of the mountain.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = Upon exposing the goo to this rather unremarkable area, it seems to pause for a moment, before shifting to... Look at you? It doesn't have eyes, but you feel judged. R&D will like this one.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The goo shrinks back into its canister, shutting the door. It seems terrified. It knows Bob is near.

		RoshFlyingLow = The goo drips out of the canister, falling away and down to Rosh. You hope that you didn't just accidentally cause a case of panspermia.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The goo leaps out, forming itself into a parachute, as though it were skydiving. You feel a bit of jealousy, seeing how fun it looks... That is, until the goo splats against the ground.
		RoshInSpaceLow = The goo draws back into its canister, seemingly frightened. As a mountain whizzes past your craft, you feel like you can relate to the goo.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = The goo appears mildly displeasured at the sight of Rosh below it, and shuts its canister. This will make R&D flip once they hear about it!

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = You scoop up a chunk of the ground. It seems to be mostly loosely compacted gravel and dust. Strangely, it seems to stick to itself well, almost akin to the kerbnetic sand you used to play with back home.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = Picking up a chunk of the soil is easy, as it is mostly pebbles and rocks here. Some ice crystals coat a few of the samples, like morning frost. You think about licking it, before realising how awful that idea is.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = Taking a sample of the soil here is not a very easy task, as the soil is now hard, bare rock. Bashing a chunk off though, you manage to retrieve a decently sized boulder... Before dropping it on your boot.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = You smack the ground with your hammer a few times, trying to break off a chunk of the rock. When you only manage to retrieve a tiny shard of rock, you begin thinking of a few choice words to tell to mission control for giving you a rubber mallet.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = You reach down and manage to pull out a rock from the ground. It appears to be a chunk of ice with layers of ash in it, giving the sample a stratified appearance. Giving it a little pull, the layers come apart easily. You recall the words of Shrek Kerman...
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = You touch the ground for a moment, noticing a fine gray dust coating everything. You scoop up a handful of it. The colour resembles that of a familiar boring gray rock that you thought didn't exist...

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The materials appear to become slightly more brittle than before. How utterly groundbreaking indeed!
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The materials nearly tumble out of the lab. Perhaps somewhere a bit flatter would've been better for this.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = A few of the materials roll out of the lab and down the hill and out of sight... Hopefully your pay didn't just get docked for that.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = As you run the experiment, you accidentally bump a few of the items, which then fall out of the lab and roll down the mountain. You decide it's not worth it to chase.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = You expose the materials to space. After a few moments, nothing of note happens, except the collection of some dust on the samples. Somehow, you find the dust settling more interesting than the location.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = Upon cracking open the lab's hatch, the materials start to glitch out, before vanishing. Bob must've collected them.

		RoshFlyingLow = The materials appear to be getting chilled by the cold air, however at a slow pace, likely due to the thin atmosphere.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The materials appear to become slightly more brittle than before. You shut the lab's doors before the materials can fall out.
		RoshInSpaceLow = The materials seem to be doing very little right now. Something falls out of the lab and smashes against a mountain.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = The materials begin glowing a little, likely from being bombarded by radiation from Axod. You begin to wonder what the samples taste like... Nobody would notice, right?

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The temperature readout hovers way below what you feel comfortable with. You subtly turn your suit's heating on.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The temperature readout hovers very far below what you feel comfortable with. You subtly turn your suit's heating on 'high'.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The temperature readout hovers extremly far below what you feel comfortable with. You subtly crank your suit's heating to max.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The thermometer readout shows no temperature data. After retrying a few more times, you decide to just estimate the temperature... Absolute zero sounded close enough.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = Checking the thermometer, you find this area to be slightly warmer than anticipated. Not that it is warm whatsoever, it's still halfway to absolute zero here.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The thermometer readout shows no temperature data. After retrying a few more times, you decide to just estimate the temperature... Absolute zero sounded close enough.

		RoshFlyingLow = Up here, the air is much colder than what it would be down on the surface. It seems that the air doesn't cycle very often. 
		RoshFlyingHigh = The thermometer reads temperatures only barely warmer than space around Rosh, implying that Rosh doesn't hold temperature all too well.
		RoshInSpaceLow = The thermometer measures the craft's temperature around Rosh, as there's no air up here. The thermometer finds the craft to be incredibly frigid. You turn on the heaters just to be sure.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = The thermometer measures the craft's temperature around Rosh, as there's no air up here. As it returns a very low value, you make a joke about wanting a 'space' heater. You hear no response from mission control, and decide that their laughter is simply delayed due to you being interstellar.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{    
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The air pressure here is exactly as expected; barely noticeable.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The air pressure here is exactly as expected; even less noticeable.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The air pressure here is exactly as expected; almost entirely unnoticeable.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = There is quite literally no air up here, yet you're still stood on solid rock. This'll give those R&D guys a good time.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = The needle on the barometer hovers around zero... You squint at it. Oh, wait, it's just really close.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = There is quite literally no air up here, as Mount Nedzer stands so tall, as though Rosh itself were trying to get rid of it.

		RoshFlyingLow = The pressure is much, much lower here than it is back on Kerbin. At least the pressure is rather stable. You doubt it storms here very often. Doesn't make this place nice, though...
		RoshFlyingHigh = You aren't sure if the barometer is even functional for a moment, as it almost seems to be hovering at zero. Upon looking closely, though, you find that it's just incredibly close to zero.
		RoshInSpaceLow = You decide to double-check that you're in a vacuum... Yep. You most certainly are. You may now rest easy.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Despite being so far from Rosh, your barometer seems to be saying that this vacuum is imperfect. Not enough to cause issues with your flight, but there are particles present.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = Gentle tremors are picked up on the sensor deep below the crust. Or was that the craft settling?
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = A nearby landslide is picked up on the sensor. You think about moving a bit further from the nearest divot.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = As the scanner runs, a distant cliff cleaves off its mountain and collapses. You feel a sudden urge to go home.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The scanner is picking up a significant amount of activity right below your feet. It seems that this mountain is still growing.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = A tremor shakes the ground as you run the experiment. It seems that due to the young nature of the system, Rosh's core is still active. You hope not to be swallowed into the depths.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The scanner picks up nothing, except a constant repeating pulse nearby. You have your suspicions on who is causing it...

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The gravity here is exactly as anticipated. You feel simply whelmed.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The gravity here is an absurdly small amount lower than anticipated. You're not reaching your weight loss goals here.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The gravity here is ever-so-slightly lower than anticipated. You take a wild guess and chalk it up to being high up.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The gravity here is low, compared to the rest of the moon. This is utterly bewildering information!
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = The gravity here is infinitesimally higher than expected, likely due to the crust being slightly denser here.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The gravity here is low, compared to the rest of the moon. At least it should make escaping from here easier.

        RoshInSpaceLow = Doubting your own understanding of physics for a moment, you decide to check the readout on the gravity scanner. Yep, Rosh has gravity.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Doubting if Rosh is even pulling on your craft, you decide to check the readout on the gravity scanner. Yep, Rosh is pulling you. Granted, there's lower gravity up here, but... Come on.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The atmosphere analysis takes slightly longer than usual to complete. Once it does, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The atmosphere analysis takes an unusually long time to complete. Once it does, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The atmosphere analysis takes a minute to complete, much longer than usual. Once it does, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The atmosphere analysis machine immediately bluescreens when you go to run it, displaying a message; [ERR: NO AIR DETECTED]. What could this mean?
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = After running the experiment, you find the atmosphere to be composed of mostly methane, with some sulphuric compounds throughout. Mission control double-dog-dares you to give it a whiff, and... Ew, it smells like onions.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The atmosphere analysis machine immediately bluescreens when you go to run it, displaying a message; [ERR: NO AIR DETECTED]. What could this mean?

		RoshFlyingLow = The atmosphere analysis takes a few moments to complete, which is noticeably longer than usual. Once it finishes, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The atmosphere analysis takes a few minutes to complete, which is significantly longer than usual. Once it finishes, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshInSpaceLow = Upon measuring the interactions between Rosh and charged particles, you notice that there does seem to be a faint magnetic field present. Despite Rosh's small size and long rotation, it seems that it hasn't yet lost its magnetic field, due to its youth.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Upon measuring the interactions between Rosh and charged particles, you notice that your equipment is being affected by a very, very faint magnetic field. You take a guess that it gets stronger the closer you get to Rosh.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:NEEDS[SquadExpansion/Serenity]:HAS[#id[deployedSeismicSensor]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLanded = Due to Rosh's youth and slightly eccentric orbit around Axod, there is a significant amount of activity below the surface. These internal motions drive Rosh's tremors, landslides, and even affect its weak magnetic field.

// Only for bodies with atmosphere.
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:NEEDS[SquadExpansion/Serenity]:HAS[#id[deployedWeatherReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		// Dysnomia
		RoshSrfLanded = Surprisingly, despite Rosh's thin atmosphere and relatively consistent pressures, its slow rotation drives large windstorms that blow around the moon, though they are largely unnoticeable due to low pressure.
