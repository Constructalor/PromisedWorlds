		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = A quick glance out the window tells you all you need to know; It's bumpy and brown out. If you squint hard enough, you can even see some mountains off in the distance.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = You look around your landing site, spotting many spikes jutting out of the ground. You shudder to think about what would've happened if you flew ever-so-slightly more recklessly.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = You enjoy the scenery that surrounds your lander. You do your best to ignore the steep cliffs and sharp spikes sticking out of the ground.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = Outside your window is the bare expanse of space. A distant glimmer in the sky catches your attention; home.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = Looking out the window, flat, brown soil stretches off into the distance. You begin to wonder if Rosh is flat, before remembering that you'd just been in orbit.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = You glance out the window, and feel an overwhelming sense of dread. Something is here... Something hidden.

		RoshFlyingLow = You look out the window, down to the ground below. You hope that you picked a good spot to land here.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The brown moon stretches on beneath you. For a moment, it looks like a fun skydive, but you know better. Probably.
		RoshInSpaceLow = As mountains whizz by scarily close to you, you wonder if it may be worth it to raise your orbit. Or maybe continue to be a daredevil. After all, it's funner.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Staring down at Rosh, you picture landing on those soaring peaks. And then you immediately picture falling off them. Maybe you should look away.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = Around you, gentle lumps and gradual dips are sprinkled about the terrain. You think for a moment... It seems flat enough for a daredevil to take off from.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The terrain here is quite rough. You glance back over to your craft to make sure it's not tipped over.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = You make sure to keep your distance from a cliff as you look around. You note how uneven the ground is, as you hear a distant thump. That wasn't the ship falling over... Right?
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = You keep away from the nearby cliffs as you radio in to mission control, cracking a joke about how 'spacey' it is up here. When met with silence in response, you decide to just tell yourself it's the delay from being interstellar.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = The soil appears to have some very prevalent stratification to it, and think to yourself, 'how cool!' You then realise that you're finding soil to the most interesting part of this location. You wish you had picked a cooler spot.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = Your legs shake as you glance around. You feel tempted to call out for Bob, but fear the consenquences if he is present.

		RoshFlyingLow = Deciding to be a daredevil, you hang on to the side of your craft as it wobbles in flight. One of your hands slip, and you begin to reconsider this whole thing.
		RoshFlyingHigh = You consider skydiving for a moment. How cool would it be to be the first to skydive on an alien world? Right as you think about it, mission control screams at you to get back in. What a bunch of party-poopers...
		RoshInSpaceLow = You begin to wonder which of these mountains will be the one lucky enough to get a new green splat mark. You also begin to wonder if you should get back in the ship.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = You gaze down at Rosh. From this far up, it looks like a rotting onion. You reach to pinch your nose in advance, but bonk your visor on accident.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The goo appears to have blobbed up into a ball. You wonder what kind of hoops could be shot with it in the low gravity.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The goo appears to have blobbed up into a ball. You wonder what kind of hoops could be shot with it in the low gravity.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The goo appears to have blobbed up into a ball. You wonder what kind of hoops could be shot with it in the low gravity.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The goo leaps out of its canister and into space! It then falls back down to Rosh quickly thereafter, off the side of the mountain.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = Upon exposing the goo to this rather layered area, it crawls out and seems to start absorbing soil. It's not exactly... Smart.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The goo shrinks back into its canister, shutting the door. It seems terrified. It knows Bob is near.

		RoshFlyingLow = The goo drips out of the canister, falling away and down to Rosh. Hopefully no mysterious colonies of sludge will be discovered here soon...
		RoshFlyingHigh = The goo leaps out, forming itself into a parachute, as though it were skydiving. It looks almost fun... That is, until the goo splats against the ground.
		RoshInSpaceLow = The goo draws back into its canister, seemingly frightened. As a mountain whizzes past the craft, you feel almost sympathetic towards the goo.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = The goo appears mildly displeasured at the sight of Rosh below it, and shuts its canister as though in protest of being dragged to such an aesthetically displeasing body.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = You scoop up a chunk of the ground. It seems to be mostly loosely compacted gravel and dust. Strangely, it seems to stick to itself well, almost akin to the kerbnetic sand you used to play with back home.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = Picking up a chunk of the soil is easy, as it is mostly pebbles and rocks here. Some ice crystals coat a few of the samples, like morning frost. You think about licking it, before realising how awful that idea is.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = Taking a sample of the soil here is not a very easy task, as the soil is hard, bare rock. Bashing a chunk off though, you manage to retrieve a decently sized boulder... Before dropping it on your boot.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = You smack the ground with your hammer a few times, trying to break off a chunk of the rock. When you only manage to retrieve a tiny shard of rock, you begin thinking of a few choice words to tell to mission control for giving you a rubber mallet.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = You reach down and manage to pull out a rock from the ground. It appears to be a chunk of ice with layers of ash in it, giving the sample a stratified appearance. Giving it a little pull, the layers come apart easily. You recall the words of Shrek Kerman...
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = You touch the ground for a moment, noticing a fine gray dust coating everything. You scoop up a handful of it. The colour resembles that of a familiar boring gray rock that you thought didn't exist...

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = A dusty layer forms on the surface of the materials in minutes. Closer examination reveals the dust to be kicked-up particles. Perhaps you should've come in a bit slower?
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The materials gain a barely-noticeable gray tint to them. Upon further analysis, it appears to be the result of some ice crystals forming on the vessel. Mmm, onion-flavoured popsicles...
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = At this altitude and temperature, the materials rather quickly begin to have any water within them boil off, due to the especially thin atmosphere. As such, your dreams of a Rosh swimming pool are dashed...
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = As the experiment runs, the materials within appear to glow occasionally, presumably due to radiation periodically reaching the samples as a result of there being no atmosphere up here.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = After a few moments of exposure, nothing of note happens except the collection of some miniscule pale, yellow frost on the materials. Analysis of said crystals show them to be a compound commonly found in onions... Stinky. 
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = Upon cracking open the lab's hatch, the materials start to glitch out, before vanishing. Bob must've collected them.

		RoshFlyingLow = The materials gently flap in the wind, before slowly turning rigid. It would seem they've frozen up from the frigid breezes Rosh presents. Perhaps a heater would be welcomed next time.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The materials begin to have their water sucked out of them due to the nearly nonexistant atmospheric pressure! You shudder to imagine what would happen to your pet fish, were it present...
		RoshInSpaceLow = The materials seem to be doing very little right now. Something falls out of the lab and smashes against a mountain.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = The materials begin glowing a little, likely from being bombarded by radiation from Axod and Debdeb. You begin to wonder what the samples taste like... Nobody would notice, right?

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The temperature readout hovers way below the preferred temperature of most kerbals. Perhaps you should contact your suit provider, and ask to upgrade to the 'warm' tier?
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The temperature readout hovers very far below the preferred temperature of most kerbals. Perhaps you should contact your suit provider, and ask to upgrade to the 'hot' tier?
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The temperature readout hovers extremly far below the preferred temperature of most kerbals. Perhaps you should contact your suit provider, and ask to upgrade to the 'roasting' tier?
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The thermometer readout shows no temperature data. After retrying a few more times, you decide to just estimate the temperature... R&D can't tell the difference, right?
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = Checking the thermometer, you find this area to be slightly warmer than anticipated. Still, it's far from warm enough for tourism. Well, there goes your business idea...
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The thermometer readout shows no temperature data. After retrying a few more times, you decide to just estimate the temperature... R&D can't tell the difference, right?

		RoshFlyingLow = Up here, the air is roughly the same temperature as it would be on the surface. It would seem that the air circulates here quite often.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The thermometer reads temperatures only barely warmer than space around Rosh, implying that Rosh doesn't hold temperature all too well.
		RoshInSpaceLow = The thermometer measures the craft's temperature around Rosh, as there's no air up here. The thermometer finds the craft to be incredibly frigid, and feel bad for it. You go to turn off a radiator so it warms up, but mission control prevents you.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = The thermometer measures the craft's temperature around Rosh, as there's no air up here. As it returns a very low value, you feel bad for the vessel, and try to deactivate a radiator to warm things up. Unfortunately, mission control block your command.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{    
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The air pressure here is exactly as expected; barely noticeable.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The air pressure here is exactly as expected; even less noticeable.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The air pressure here is exactly as expected; almost entirely unnoticeable.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = There is quite literally no air up here, yet you're still stood on solid rock. This'll give those R&D guys a good time.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = The needle on the barometer hovers around zero... You squint at it. Oh, wait, it's just really close.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = There is quite literally no air up here, as Mount Nedzer stands so incredibly tall. It's as though Rosh itself were trying to get rid of it.

		RoshFlyingLow = The pressure is much, much lower here than it is back on Kerbin. Not just that, but it appears to be fluctuating often, implying it storms often. Hopefully the craft is stable enough...
		RoshFlyingHigh = You aren't sure if the barometer is even functional for a moment, as it almost seems to be hovering at zero. Upon looking closely, though, you find that it's just incredibly close to zero.
		RoshInSpaceLow = You decide to double-check that you're in a vacuum... Yep. You most certainly are. You may now rest easy.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Despite being so far from Rosh, your barometer seems to be saying that this vacuum is imperfect. Not enough to cause issues with your flight, but there are particles present.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = Gentle tremors are picked up on the sensor deep below the crust. Or was that the craft settling?
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = A nearby landslide is picked up on the sensor. Maybe it woudld be a good idea to move a bit further from the nearest divot?
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = As the scanner runs, a distant cliff cleaves off its mountain and collapses, shaking the scanner well. Glad the vessel's not over there, eh?
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The scanner is picking up a significant amount of activity right below your craft. It seems that this mountain is still growing.
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = A tremor shakes the ground as you run the experiment. It seems that due to the young nature of the system, Rosh's core is still active. Hopefully where you landed is stable...
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The scanner picks up nothing, except a constant repeating pulse nearby. You have your suspicions on who is causing it...

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The gravity here is exactly as anticipated. You feel simply whelmed.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The gravity here is an absurdly small amount lower than anticipated. You're not reaching your weight loss goals here.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The gravity here is ever-so-slightly lower than anticipated. You take a wild guess and chalk it up to being high up.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The gravity here is low, compared to the rest of the moon. This is utterly bewildering information!
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = The gravity here is infinitesimally higher than expected, likely due to the crust being slightly denser here.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The gravity here is low, compared to the rest of the moon. At least it should make escaping from here easier.

        RoshInSpaceLow = Doubting your own understanding of physics for a moment, you decide to check the readout on the gravity scanner. Yep, Rosh has gravity.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Doubting if Rosh is even pulling on your craft, you decide to check the readout on the gravity scanner. Yep, Rosh is pulling you. Granted, there's lower gravity up here, but... Come on.

	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshSrfLandedLowlands = The atmosphere analysis takes slightly longer than usual to complete. Once it does, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.
		RoshSrfLandedMidlands = The atmosphere analysis takes an unusually long time to complete. Once it does, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.
		RoshSrfLandedHighlands = The atmosphere analysis takes a minute to complete, much longer than usual. Once it does, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.
		RoshSrfLandedPeaks = The atmosphere analysis machine immediately bluescreens when you go to run it, displaying a message; [ERR: NO AIR DETECTED]. What could this mean?
		RoshSrfLandedPlanitia = After running the experiment, you find the atmosphere to be composed of mostly methane, with some sulphuric compounds throughout. You wonder if the sample smells of onions.
		RoshSrfLandedMountNedzer = The atmosphere analysis machine immediately bluescreens when you go to run it, displaying a message; [ERR: NO AIR DETECTED]. What could this mean?

		RoshFlyingLow = The atmosphere analysis takes a few moments to complete, which is noticeably longer than usual. Once it finishes, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.
		RoshFlyingHigh = The atmosphere analysis takes a few minutes to complete, which is significantly longer than usual. Once it finishes, you find the composition of the air to be mostly methane.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RoshInSpaceLow = Upon measuring the interactions between Rosh and charged particles, you notice that there does seem to be a faint magnetic field present. Despite Rosh's small size and long rotation, it seems that it hasn't yet lost its magnetic field, due to its youth.
		RoshInSpaceHigh = Upon measuring the interactions between Rosh and charged particles, you notice that your equipment is being affected by a very, very faint magnetic field. You take a guess that it gets stronger the closer you get to Rosh.

	{
		RoshSrfLanded = Due to Rosh's youth and slightly eccentric orbit around Axod, there is a significant amount of activity below the surface. These internal motions drive Rosh's tremors, landslides, and even affect its weak magnetic field.
