		GlumoSrfLanded = Uhhhh...\nWell...since you made it this far, you might as well keep going, right?
		GlumoFlyingLow = It is frighteningly dark outside. Superbolt flashes illuminate a cloudscape far from the soothing blues and oranges in the upper decks.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Oranges, blues, and the mysterious colour in between swirl, combine, and separate around the craft. So pretty!
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Purple, orange, and blue are the last colours you would expect to see together, yet here, they just work. Who knew a gas giant could be so charming?
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Glumo is such an amazing planet. It's too bad someone already put a ring on it.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = The bottoms of the clouds are beautiful. You're fairly certain you're doomed.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = As you fly among them, you are terrified by the true scale of the massive clouds.
		GlumoInSpaceLow = The clouds look so soft you could reach out and touch them. You probably shouldn't, though.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = The shadows of Glumo's moons crawl across the surface.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = A flash of lightning momentarily blinds you. In the next moment, the goo is nowhere to be seen.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = The goo has picked up an electric charge and stands in several spikes.
		GlumoInSpaceLow = The goo seems to take the shape of the complex, rippling patterns in the clouds below.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Small ridges have formed in the goo.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = The immense pressures have destroyed most of the materials.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = A light blue residue is forming on some of the materials. You scrape some off and store it for analysis.
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Some of the materials are responding to the powerful magnetic fields.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = The materials are lit by the brilliant glow of the protoplanetary disk.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = At this depth, the immense pressure heats the atmosphere, causing massive convection currents.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Glumo's steady diet of small moons has kept its atmosphere quite hot.
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Space around Glumo is just like other space, except Glumier. That has nothing to do with temperature, though, so there's not much to report.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Posters of Glumo portrayed it surrounded by flames due its reddish colours. You can now safely say that Glumo is not on fire.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{    
		GlumoFlyingLow = With that many zeroes, the number doesn't really matter.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Despite your great altitude, the pressure is significant.
		GlumoInSpaceLow = The pressure reading is firmly planted at zero. Not much is going to change that, unless you enter Glumo's atmosphere.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = The barometer is hit by a tiny piece of debris from Glumo's rings and momentarily reports an astoundingly high pressure.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoInSpaceLow = Glumo's gravity is incredibly powerful. It's used this influence to amass a collection of moons - perhaps as pets?
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = The huge gap in Debdeb's planetary disk is evidence enough of Glumo's mighty gravity.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoFlyingLow = Deeper into Glumo's atmosphere, compounds form an enormous blanket of clouds, whose motion creates powerful lightning.
		GlumoFlyingHigh = Glumo's atmosphere has many different bands with different compositions, producing its striking appearance from space. The atmosphere contains particulate debris, perhaps from asteroids it has absorbed.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[magnetometer]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoinSpaceLow = The magnetic field is caused by electrical currents deep within Glumo. These readings are sure to give valuable insight about its mysterious core.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = Glumo's size gives it a powerful magnetic field, which has led to the formation of radiation belts. At least its pants won't fall down.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[evaScience]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		GlumoInSpaceLow = The spinning flange reflects Glumo's calming colours. Watching it is quite relaxing. Oh, and there's those fundamental laws of physics.
		GlumoInSpaceHigh = As you spin part number 882839B-RevD, you're alarmed to see that Glumo itself starts spinning! After a moment of panic, you realize that it's just you spinning in the opposite direction.
