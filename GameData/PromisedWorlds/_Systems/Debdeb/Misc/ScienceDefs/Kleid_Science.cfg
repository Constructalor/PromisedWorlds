	@RESULTS
	{
		KleidSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is rocky. You wonder how much money a Kleid rock would go for back home.
		KleidSrfLandedMidlands = The ground is pebbly. You spot a perfectly round pebble near the craft and immediately regret not bringing your golf club.
		KleidSrfLandedHighlands = The ground is fragmented. This would be a bad place to drop a screw while trying to repair the craft.
		KleidSrfLandedMountains = The ground is jagged. You make a mental note: don't let the Kerbinauts outside in just their space socks.
		KleidSrfLandedPoles = There is not much going on. You wonder if there is a Mohole somewhere around here.
		KleidSrfLandedCanyons = These trenches put the Dres canyon to shame. Basically, there is no longer any good reason to visit Dres.\n\nI wonder if Stratzen Kerblitz would be able to bridge this.
		KleidInSpaceLow = Kleid's canyons snake across its surface, carving intricate paths into the stone.
		KleidInSpaceHigh = Astronomers once renamed Kleid to Heartbreak to protest the reclassification of Eeloo to "dwarf planet". It remains Heartbreak to many today.
