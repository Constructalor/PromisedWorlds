// Science Definitions for Debdeb

// Template instructions: Find and replace "Planet" with the body's name. Add any applicable biomes and remove any unneeded entries (i.e. splashed on a planet without water).

// I wasn't able to get very close to Debdeb without exploding even when covered with radiators, so I'm not writing Flying configs for now -levitato5594

		DebdebSrfLanded = What a day to have eyes. \n\n...And, there they go.
		DebdebFlyingLow = You can see Debdeb's sunspots in great detail now. That is not a good thing.
		DebdebFlyingHigh = You take a quick glance at Debdeb's surface and instantly regret your decision.
		DebdebInSpaceLow = Radiation levels outside are approaching lethal levels.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = We are on a journey far from home, basking in the light of a million interstellar fireflies.
		//DebdebInSpaceLow = You feel a great sense of adventure, exploring a star system in its infancy.
		//DebdebInSpaceHigh = You can't help but feel homesick this far from Kerbol.

		DebdebSrfLanded = You've made it. We were waiting for you. Welcome to this configuration file. That's right, it's real, and it lives in the center of Debdeb. By landing, you've proved your worth.

		DebdebInSpaceLow = The dazzling protoplanetary disk takes up much of the sky, broken only by the planets carving out their paths.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = Looking back, you can see Kerbol - it's only a small speck in the sky.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DebdebSrfLanded = The goo expands in every direction, absorbing Debdeb's power. It is too late to stop it.

		//DebdebFlyingHigh = This definition has not yet been written. If you see this in game, please report it to the developers.
		DebdebInSpaceLow = The goo scoffs at Debdeb.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = The goo squirms awkwardly. It seems apprehensive about this system.

		DebdebFlyingLow = The materials have been entirely vaporized by Debdeb.
		DebdebFlyingHigh = The materials bubble and fizz as they boil.
		DebdebInSpaceLow = Some of the materials are looking rather melty. Hey, there's that chocolate bar!
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = A foam sample appears to have collected some space dust while the doors were open. Maybe you should study that!

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		DebdebFlyingLow = The thermometer seems to have vaporized.
		DebdebFlyingHigh = The liquid in the thermometer has swelled to the point that the glass is bulging outward.
		DebdebInSpaceLow = You're glad that, unlike Charr, you aren't this close to a star forever. You packed everything for a return trip, right?
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = Lower radiative heating means that the thermometer maintains a lower temperature compared to around Kerbol.

		DebdebInSpaceLow = A minuscule pressure reading is present. The young Debdeb system still has a faint amount of gas.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = Debdeb's protoplanetary disk swirls with gasses and dust, still in the process of combining into a mature system of planets.

		DebdebInSpaceLow = The massive, churning protoplanetary disk causes small deviations in gravity.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = Debdeb has lower gravity than Kerbol, since it's smaller. It is just a baby, after all!

		DebdebInSpaceLow = You remember the study of the complicated interactions in stars being called "magnetohydrodynamics." Thankfully, the textbook was too heavy to bring with you.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = Kerbin's astrologers refer to Debdeb as a young and reckless star, known for its misbehavior and antics. The complex interactions between its magnetic field and the protoplanetary disks seem to confirm their theories.

		DebdebInSpaceLow = The flange dances back and forth, reflecting Debdeb's light. You can see the reflection of Debdeb's protoplanetary disk in its shiny surface.
		DebdebInSpaceHigh = Even this far from Kerbin, the flange flips back and forth. There's something strangely comforting - that even in this unfamiliar system, the laws of physics are still the same.
