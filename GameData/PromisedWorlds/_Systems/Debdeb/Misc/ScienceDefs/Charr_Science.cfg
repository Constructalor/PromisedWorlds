		CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = You are not sure how you landed here. Best not to think about it too hard.
		CharrSrfLandedHotCraters =  You admire the fiery crater center. Meanwhile, your craft melts into the ground like a microwaved butter tower.
		CharrSrfLandedMidlands = Glowing bands of iron flow down the endless craters into their soft, gooey centers. You wish the Kerbolar System had a lava planet this epic (sorry, Moho).
		CharrSrfLandedHighlands = The metal beneath your craft glows a soft orange. It reminds you of hot summer days, campfires, and orange kerbsicles.
		CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = An ocean of fire flows over the horizon and out of sight. It is truly a gorgeous sight.
		CharrSplashed = The cabin walls glowing can't be a good sign.
		CharrInSpaceLow = Charr's glowing surface stretches, folds, and flows in a mesmerizing fire dance.
		CharrInSpaceHigh = The surface is pockmarked, red, and inflamed--a bad case of space acne.

		CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = This is a most precarious situation.
		CharrSrfLandedHotCraters = Everything you touch is extremely hot. Your suit can't take much more of this.
		CharrSrfLandedMidlands = You shield your eyes from the blinding sun, but the ground reflects it right back at you.
		CharrSrfLandedHighlands = You shuffle your feet. The ground is completely solid.
		CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = The terrain reminds you of a nightmare you had as a child.
		CharrSplashed = When you said you needed a hot bath, this wasn't what you had in mind.
		CharrInSpaceLow = The view from here is oddly terrifying.
		CharrInSpaceHigh = The view is incredible until you glance in the wrong direction and hurt your eyes.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = The glowing sample immediately eats through the container. However, that is the least of your concerns right now.
		CharrSrfLandedHotCraters = The ground is malleable from the heat and a sample is collected with a hammer. The red-hot sample is pure metallic iron.
		CharrSrfLandedMidlands = The sample consists of metallic iron with some tiny impurities and loose rocks.
		CharrSrfLandedHighlands = The sample consists of metallic iron with impurities mingled throughout
		CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = The ground here is completely solid, so getting a sample here is difficult. After much struggling with tools, you manage to obtain a chunk of pure metallic iron.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{    
		CharrSrfLanded = There is no atmosphere here. Any gases have been blasted away by Debdeb's raging winds.
		CharrInSpaceLow = The barometer doesn't show much pressure, but looking down at the horrible molten world below, you certainly feel it!
		CharrInSpaceHigh = Any pressure here is a result of Debdeb's atmosphere. With the intense power of the solar winds, Charr is unable to retain any gasses of its own.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = The flowing lava in these craters is made of molten iron. The sheer volume combined with its density means that fluid flow is a significant contributor to Charr's gravity fields.
		CharrSrfLandedHotCraters = These deep impact craters are proof enough of Charr's gravity - it's clearly pulled many objects in over its short life. Looking up at Debdeb, it's clear that the same fate now befalls it.
		CharrSrfLandedMidlands = The midlands have the most normal gravity of all of Charr - that is, pretty strong. You hope you packed enough fuel to leave.
		CharrSrfLandedHighlands = Charr's strong gravity was apparent enough during the landing. The meter only confirms these suspicions.
		CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = These mighty mountains are made of dense iron, which makes them massive enough to have their own gravitaional pull.
		CharrInSpaceLow = The gravity field around Charr fluctuates as you orbit. The massive iron mountains have a significant pull. Objects orbiting Charr likely decay quickly as these lumps pull them off their paths.
		CharrInSpaceHigh = As is evidenced by the protoplanetary disk blanketing Charr, its gravity is a relatively minor force in this region. The swirling disk above obeys no master but Debdeb.

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		CharrInSpaceLow = Closer to Charr's surface, the variation in magnetic field is much greater as you pass over concentrations of molten iron. At one point, Charr may have had more typical terrestrial composition, but in the extreme conditions close to Debdeb, this metallic planet is what remains.
		CharrInSpaceHigh = Though Debdeb's magnetic field dominates this close to the star, Charr is no slouch. Its magnetic field has slight fluctuations where molten iron flows across its surface.

		//Of course it's the frozen banana animation on the super hot planet.
		CharrSrfLandedMoltenCraters = Your vision warps and bends. You open the science kit to find exactly what you need right now - a wonderful, ripe, frozen fruit. You grab your sample hammer to break it open, but it seems you swung too hard in Charr's intense gravity. The fruit shatters, disappering around you. Your vision straightens as you realize you've just hit your hand. Ouch!
		CharrSrfLandedHotCraters = Grabbing your sample hammer, you swing it to break open a geode you found. It's only too late that you snap out of it and realize you've just smashed your frozen snack. You were going to eat that later!
		CharrSrfLandedMidlands = This experiment was originally supposed to be related to cultivation or something, but any of that is out of the question on Charr. All you can do now is watch as the fragments of fruit fizz and steam on the hot ground.
		CharrSrfLandedHighlands = While there was some science experiment to be performed, the heat is making it hard to concentrate. You find a nice looking fruit, still frozen, and try to take a sample of it. It breaks into many pieces, hissing and boiling on the hot ground.
		CharrSrfLandedMetallicMountains = Dizzy from the heat and exhausted from the gravity, your dreams have come true! A nice, cold frozen treat, right when you need it the most. You've just got to break off this sample first - No! That was the snack!
		CharrSrfLanded = While there was some science experiment to be performed, the heat is making it hard to concentrate. You find a nice looking fruit, still frozen, and try to take a sample of it. It breaks into many pieces, hissing and boiling on the hot ground.
		CharrInSpaceLow = It's a bit hard to see the flange spinning. Brilliant flashes fill your vision as Debdeb's powerful radiation hits your corneas. It may not be a good idea to stay here too long...
		CharrInSpaceHigh = While it's good to see the same physical effects holding up, you could have chosen a less intense place to test them. There are better times to demonstrate fundamental laws of physics.
