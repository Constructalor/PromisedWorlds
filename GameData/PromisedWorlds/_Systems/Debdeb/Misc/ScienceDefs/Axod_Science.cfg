		AxodSrfLanded = AUGHHHH AUGHHHHHHHHH A--\n\n*Inhales*\n\n--UGHHHHHHH
		AxodFlyingLow = The wind roars outside as you traverse the lower cloud decks. You suspect the craft will be torn asunder long before it reaches crush depth.
		AxodFlyingHigh = Creamy blues and whites race by, curling and swirling into blueberry parfait goodness.
		AxodInSpaceLow = Lightning flashes pierce through the cloud bands. The white bands ride high, revealing frigid cyan maelstroms deeper in the interior.
		AxodInSpaceHigh = Axod is Glumo's forgotten cousin. With muted colors, smaller rings, and a sequence of dim, muddy moons, many believe that visiting the planet is waste of taxpayer funds. Fortunately, more enlightened minds run our space program.
