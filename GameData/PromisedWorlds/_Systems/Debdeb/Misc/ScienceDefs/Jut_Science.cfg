		JutSrfLanded = We're basically on a more battered version of Gilly. It's a moon...of a moon...of a planet with many other significant moons. Yeah...this thing's orbit definitely isn't stable. Let's get out of here.
		JutInSpaceLow = The surface is so cratered, it's hard to tell how many craters went into the creation of one misshapen divot.
		JutInSpaceHigh = Huh.\nYou know, if you squint, Jut kind of looks like Moho.
