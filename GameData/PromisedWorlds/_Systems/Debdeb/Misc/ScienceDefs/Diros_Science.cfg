		DirosSrfLanded = The ground is jagged, cratered, and generally unpleasant to land on. Overhead, Jut performs a mesmerizing orbital dance. Let's hope it doesn't get pulled into a collision trajectory with us.
		DirosInSpaceLow = The surface is so cratered, it's hard to tell how many craters went into the creation of one misshapen divot.
		DirosInSpaceHigh = Huh.\nYou know, if you squint, Diros kind of looks like Moho.
