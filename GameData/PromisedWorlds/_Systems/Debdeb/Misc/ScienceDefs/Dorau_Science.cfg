		//WPetula
		DorauSrfLandedShores = Liquid nitrogen gently washes over the shoreline. You know, the shore might be cold, but in comparison to the oceans, it's a tropical paradise.
		DorauSrfLandedLowlands = The coasts are a cloudy wasteland of ice, rock, and the occasional snowstorm. They are a perfect balance between gloomy and cozy.
		DorauSrfLandedMidlands = Jagged animal stripes of rock and mineral veins carve elaborate patterns through the ice. Your eyes trace the paths as they vanish off into the snowy haze.
		DorauSrfLandedHighlands = Shimmering clouds of ice shards drift by, showering the craft in frozen bits and bobs. Sunlight refracts through the airborne crystals and cascades onto the slopes as mini rainbows.
		DorauSrfLandedNitrogenSeas = You try to share your thoughts, but your jaw is frozen shut, and you left your crowbar at home. Perhaps it's time to go elsewhere.
		//DorauSplashed = This definition has not yet been written. If you see this in game, please report it to the developers.
		DorauFlyingLow = Flying conditions are favorable right now. Thick atmosphere? Low gravity? All right!
		DorauFlyingHigh = A feeling of calm washes over you. It's so peaceful out here.
		DorauInSpaceLow = A large polar low circles over one of Dorau's nitrogen seas. It is hypnotizingly calm.
		DorauInSpaceHigh = A comically large atmosphere rests atop the cold, yellow-grey plains of Dorau. Soft as a lullaby, it calls to you, beckoning you to sleep.
