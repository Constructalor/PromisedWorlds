		//WPetula
		ShanaSrfLandedLowlands = The ground is smooth, rocky, and dusty all at the same time. You aren't really sure what's going on, actually.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkLowlands = The ground is...uh...hmm. You strain your eyes but can't see anything in the darkness.
		ShanaSrfLandedMidlands = There's not a whole lot going on here. Rocky crags race off across Shana's surface in all directions, but there isn't anything particularly interesting to see.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkMidlands = You write down your observations of the situation.\n\nDark. It is very dark. Note to self: bring flashlight next time.
		ShanaSrfLandedHighlands = Glumo's rings shine brightly above the dull, rocky surface.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkHighlands = You stare into the darkness, trying to make a witty observation about the moon's surface. Regrettably, giving Kerbals night vision never left the R&D stage.
		ShanaSrfLandedMountains = The other moons of the Glumo System shine brightly in the sky. Below, the brownish, greyish, orangish, yellowish surface of Shana lays unfazed.
		ShanaSrfLandedDarkMountains = It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a Krue.
		ShanaSrfLandedPoles = What fun is visiting the poles if there isn't any snow? Anyway, onto the next destination, please.
		ShanaSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = A jagged row of mountains advances along the equator and out of sight. Loose gravel and dust shifts beneath the craft.
		ShanaInSpaceLow = There doesn't seem to be a whole lot going on down there. If it wasn't for the ridge, Shana would just be a boring, brown ball.
		ShanaInSpaceHigh = Shana's equatorial ridge has a unique flow to it. It seems to be pulling the surrounding terrain clockwise around the moon.\n\n...Or is it counterclockwise?
