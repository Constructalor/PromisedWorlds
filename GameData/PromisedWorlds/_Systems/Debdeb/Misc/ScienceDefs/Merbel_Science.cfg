		MerbelSrfLandedDeepSeas = BRRRRrRRRrRr
		MerbelSrfLandedSeas = COLD COLD COLD WHY ARE WE DOWN HERE--?
		MerbelSrfLandedShallowSeas = Little bubbles jiggle through the brackish water as they rise to the surface. Meanwhile, the craft jiggles through the water because it is cold.
		MerbelSrfLandedCoasts = Deep blue water laps at the stony, grey-blue shore. Lonely flakes of snow settle and absorb into the waves.
		MerbelSrfLandedLowlands = The air is dangerously cold from the humidity. Emulsified water droplets freeze on contact with the craft.
		MerbelSrfLandedMidlands = The wind comes and goes, showering the craft with snowflakes and ice fleks.
		MerbelSrfLandedHighlands = The wind is frustratingly cold at this altitude. The craft groans in anguish at the extreme temperatures.
		MerbelSrfLandedMountains = Thin air? Check. Deathly cold temperatures? Check. Scary ice monster about to eat us? Let's hope not.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarDeepSeas = BRRRRrRRRrRr\n\nGET US OUT OF HEREEEEEEE
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarSeas = COLD COLD COLD WHY ARE WE DOWN HERE--?\nWHYYYYYYY?????
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarShallowSeas = Little bubbles collect into an air pool underneath the polar ice. You hope that doesn't mean the craft has a leak somewhere.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarCoasts = It is not clear where the coast ends and the ice sheets begin.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The continent is locked underneath at least 10 meters of ice. Us too, if we stay here.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarMidlands = Snowdrifts and snow devils slam the craft as the wind tumbles toward the lowlands.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarHighlands = The craft buckles and shakes in the extreme environment.
		MerbelSrfLandedPolarMountains = Take us out of this frozen whirlwind, or else...uh...\n\n...or else we'll eat the rest of the SNACKS.
		//MerbelSplashed = This definition has not yet been written. If you see this in game, please report it to the developers.
		MerbelFlyingLow = There is a lots of packed snow down there. Do you think we can make a quick stop for shaved ice? I brought mango syrup!
		MerbelFlyingHigh = There are snow worlds, and then there's MERBEL. Just look at those deep blue waves and stone-cold icecaps...
		MerbelInSpaceLow = It's amazing that Merbel has clouds. You half expect them to see them flash-freeze into spongy vapor bricks and plummet to the ground.
		MerbelInSpaceHigh = Mmmm...blue raspberry sorbet. I hope those oceans taste as good as they look.
