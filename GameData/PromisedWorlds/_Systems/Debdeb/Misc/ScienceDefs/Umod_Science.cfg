		//WPetula
		UmodSrfLandedLowlands = The ground has an almost taffy-like appearance, stretching and folding between the rocks.
		UmodSrfLandedMidlands = The ground has stretch marks. Umod's collision must have been sudden, unpleasant, and a major contributor of its mass.
		UmodSrfLandedHighlands = These mounds of pyroclastic rock extend high above Umod's surface--no doubt a result of its traumatic collision event.
		UmodSrfLandedMountains = We are at the tippy top of the largest pyroclastic mounds ever discovered. Science is awesome!
		UmodSrfLandedCraters = It's odd how few craters there are. Maybe Umod only cooled after most of the collision fragments rejoined its mass?
		UmodSrfLandedCraterPeaks = These impacts must have been especially violent to generate these peaks. Yikes!
		UmodInSpaceLow = The surface is dimpled but not cratered. There are a lot of crazy color patterns going on down there.
		UmodInSpaceHigh = Umod has the texture of a butterball and the appearance of a butterball accidentally dropped into a rocket engine.
