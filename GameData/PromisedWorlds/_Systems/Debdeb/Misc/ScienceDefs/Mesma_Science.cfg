		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = A labyrinth of trenches towers over the ship. According to Kerbal folklore, The Kraken wanders these cosmic halls, searching for tasty playthings.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = The flat, slick terrain is perfect for ring gazing.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = The ground is rocky with a touch of forbidden ice-dirt sorbet.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = The ground slopes down toward the icy wastelands below.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = This is one of the mountains of all time. Can we visit the canyons next?
		MesmaInSpaceLow = It's amazing how a moon can so smooth and so fractured at the same time. Mesma would be an awesome place to go skiing.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = Mesma looks like a chunk of desert that got left in the sun too long. Since ice plains are technically deserts, this assessment isn't really  far from the truth.

	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = You are surrounded by the massive walls of this canyon. This would be a good place for rock climbing!
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = The icy surface continues in every direction, broken only by occasional rocks.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = The gravelly ground crunches underneath your boots. At least you're not slipping on the ice sheets.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = You have to be careful not to trip - despite Mesma's weaker gravity, a tumble down this hill wouldn't be fun.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = Thanks to the otherwise flat geography, the mountains afford you a grand view of Mesma.
		MesmaInSpaceLow = From close above the surface, Mesma's cracks are huge. It must have taken great forces to create these.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = The cracks running through Mesma's surface remind you of a freshly baked brownie. This has to be one of the tastier looking moons.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = A nervous wiggle suggests the goo feels claustraphobic in this canyon.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = The goo flattens a bit, taking on a cool blue colour.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = The goo makes a strange series of movements - you're really not sure how to interpret it.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = The mystery goo forms a small ball, rolling to the downhill side of its container.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = The goo is equally afraid and in awe of the moon before it.
		MesmaInSpaceLow = The goo seems impatient. Do something already!
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = You see Axod's rings reflected in the goo's shiny surface.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = The material around the cracks has been subjected to extremely violent forces. The rocks exhibit signs of brittle fracturing, and smaller material has been thrown about from the event.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = It takes some force, but you break off a sample. Frozen within the ice are small, sharp pieces of gravel.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = A curious rock catches your attention - you think this may be from Mesma's twin Omasa - perhaps it was thrown off by an impact and made its way here!
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = The hills are littered with many rocks. Perhaps if not for Mesma, these would be part of Axod's rings!
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = Many rocks line the sides of the mountain. After accidentally knocking one down the side, you manage to put a sample away.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = The walls of the crack shield the materials from some cosmic radiation, slowing their degradation on some surfaces.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = Mesma's lower gravity allow some of the crystals to grow further upward than they did in the lab on Kerbin.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = The materials might be more comfortable here than on the ice sheets. They don't talk, so it's hard to tell.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = One of the materials falls out and tumbles down the hill. That has to be an expensive mistake.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = Higher up from Mesma's surface, some of the crystals grow even taller in unique formations.
		MesmaInSpaceLow = One of the materials seems to become discoloured.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = The materials sit calmly in their holders. They're not doing much right now.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = Shadowed by the walls of the enormous crack, the ground here is colder.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = The rock and ice stay well below freezing. There is no liquid water to be found here.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = These flats are free of the ice that covers much of Mesma's surface. That doesn't mean they're not cold!
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = The slopes vary in temperature - those facing Debdeb are much warmer than those angled away.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = The mountains have nothing to shade them and receive direct light from Debdeb, making them a bit warmer than the rest of Mesma.'
		MesmaInSpaceLow = You're not sure why the KSC scientists want temperature measurements of space here. They could get those around Kerbin too.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = It seems like space here is super hot! Wait, you read the temperature in the wrong units.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{    
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = If Mesma had an atmosphere, it would be a bit denser here. Since it doesn't, the barometer registers no changes.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = Mesma's icy surface is exposed directly to the vacuum of space. There is no atmosphere to protect it.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = No atmosphere is present - the rocks here have jagged edges, not weathered by wind or rain.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = The barometer reads zero pressure. Perhaps all the air flowed down the hill?
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = It's harder to breathe here than on Kerbin's mountains. Probably because Kerbin has an atmosphere.
		MesmaInSpaceLow = Even here, the barometer doesn't register any pressure in space. Wouldn't it be cooler if there was air everywhere? You could use jet engines between planets!
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = The spacecraft's systems are all at nominal pressures, at least. Space is still a vacuum.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = It seems like seismic waves are amplified here, perhaps due to some abnormality deep within focusing them here.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = The seismometer records some pinging sounds, which you believe to be ice breaking.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = Occasional light popping seems to suggest that parts of Mesma's crust are under very significant stress.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = Thankfully, there is minimal seismic activity here at this moment. You don't want a landslide!
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = The seismometer shows no signs of volcanic activity in these mountains.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = The cracks put you closer to the center of Mesma, though not close enough to make a difference in its weak gravity.
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = Mesma's gravity is small, though it's enough that you could walk around.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = The low gravity is nothing remarkable. Mesma's unique twinned orbit with Omasa, however, is quite unique!
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = Mesma's gravity is a bit weaker in this spot. Perhaps it is not a constant density?
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = Higher off Mesma's surface, the gravity is even weaker.
		MesmaInSpaceLow = Mesma would be an ideal location for low-gravity winter sports.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = You note the gravitational forces exerted on Mesma - its twin, Omasa, pulls on it from the other side of Axod.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[magnetometer]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaInSpaceLow = Mesma lacks any significant magnetic field, which suggests it does not have a metallic core like Kerbin.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = Axod's powerful magnetic field dominates here, as Mesma has no field of its own.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[evaScience]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLandedCracks = Tiny chunks of frozen fruit join the ice and rock littering the canyon floor. What is the point of this?
		MesmaSrfLandedIceSheets = You think this may have been left in the EVA kit by accident. Like the ice sheets, it's frozen solid.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyFlats = That hammer was meant to let you take a sample of the rocks around you. The fruit's properties could be studied easier on Kerbin.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockySlopes = This would be a nice view for a snack. Instead you're destroying it. It your soul to destroy a good snack.
		MesmaSrfLandedRockyMountains = That was your only fruit ration left! It was supposed to be a snack for after the experiment.
		MesmaInSpaceLow = Spinning the flange sends you rolling in the opposite direction. You should have paid attention in physics class! Unlike the flange, you don't flip directions.
		MesmaInSpaceHigh = You wonder if the flange's movement will be affected by Omasa's position opposite Mesma. Maybe that's the reason it keeps flipping directions?

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:NEEDS[SquadExpansion/Serenity]:HAS[#id[deployedSeismicSensor]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLanded = Seismic waves take unusual paths through Mesma's interior. They show large sections of different densities, which reflect and focus waves to certain locations on the surface. These locations are where Mesma's dramatic cracks have formed.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:NEEDS[SquadExpansion/Serenity]:HAS[#id[deployedIONCollector]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		MesmaSrfLanded = Due to its position around Axod, Mesma is subject to a continuous bombardment of charged particles deflected by Axod's powerful magnetic field. If it had an atmosphere, there would probably be pretty auroras!
